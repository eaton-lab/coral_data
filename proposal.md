# Project Proposal

## Project Goal

**What task/goal will the project accomplish and why is this useful?**  
_A concise statement of what your program does and why it’s valuable or interesting. Convince the reader that your project is worth their time._

## User Input

**What type of data/input will a user provide to the program?**  
_Describe how users will interact with your program and what kind of input they need to provide (e.g., keystrokes, command-line arguments, file uploads, etc.)._

## Data Sources

**Where will the data come from?**  
_Explain where your program gets its data:_
- _Is it user-provided?_
- _Is it generated by the program?_
- _Is it from a local file like a CSV or JSON?_
- _Is it from an API or online database?_

_If it’s from a REST API, include:_
- _Link to the API documentation_
- _Which endpoints you plan to use_
- _Any access limits or rules_
- _An example of the data format_

## User Interaction

**How will a user interact with the program?**  
_Describe the interface—CLI, GUI, web app, game controls, etc._

_If applicable, include a mock usage example, like:_
```bash
$ python my_program.py --input data.csv --mode analysis
